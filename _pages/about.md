Hello! I am **Valerio Guarrasi**, Assistant Professor at **Università Campus Bio-Medico of Rome**. My research focuses on **multimodal deep learning** and **generative AI**, with the aim of developing innovative methodologies for biomedical applications. I am particularly interested in how AI can support healthcare by improving diagnostics and patient outcomes.

My academic and professional journey has been shaped by experiences in **South Korea**, the **United States**, **Sweden**, and **Italy**, giving me a broad, multicultural perspective that informs my approach to research and collaboration. I hold a **PhD** and **Master’s Degree in Data Science** from **Sapienza University of Rome**, as well as a **Bachelor’s Degree in Management Engineering**. In addition to my research, I am committed to mentoring students and fostering collaborative projects.

I invite you to explore my work and connect if you share an interest in advancing AI for healthcare or developing novel methodologies in AI.
