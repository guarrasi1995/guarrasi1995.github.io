I am Valerio Guarrasi, an Italian Data Scientist who has lived in South Korea, the United States and Italy, defining my multicultural background and education. 

My attraction towards the technological world, its fast-changing nature and how it affects the dynamics of our reality, has determined my academic path. 
I completed my PhD and Master’s Degree in Data Science at Sapienza University in Rome after obtaining my Bachelor’s Degree in Management Engineering.

Currently, I am Assistant Professor at Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma, focusing on the optimization of multimodal deep learning for bio-medical applications.
