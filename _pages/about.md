I am Valerio Guarrasi, a passionate Italian Data Scientist whose career and personal journey have been enriched by living in South Korea, the United States, Sweden and Italy. This unique blend of experiences has shaped my multicultural perspective and academic path.

Driven by a fascination with the ever-evolving technological landscape and its profound impact on our societal reality, I have pursued an academic career that mirrors this interest. I earned both my PhD and Master's Degree in Data Science from Sapienza University of Rome, following a Bachelor's Degree in Management Engineering.

Currently, I hold the position of Assistant Professor at Università Campus Bio-Medico of Rome. My research is primarily focused on enhancing multimodal deep learning techniques for biomedical applications, a field where I aim to contribute significantly by leveraging my diverse background and expertise.
